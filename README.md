# Tribe of AI | Workshops

During the first Tribe of AI meetup, we announced our special surprise for you - artificial intelligence workshops. We want to use the workshops to achieve great things, so I'd like to explain what they will be exactly and why should you join them. The main idea behind our approach to teaching you AI is to help you avoid mistakes while learning. This may seem easy, but I see people in the forums wasting their time (months and even years) learning exactly the wrong things. Not to mention that I have made a number of mistakes myself, even after spending quite a lot of time planning and thinking about how to learn this subject.

## The Goal

The goal of the Workshops is to help you learn AI to a point, where you are ready to start working as an AI engineer in a company, start your own AI startup or/and continue your AI education to become a world-class AI expert.

## The Principles

1. We do not create content - there are brilliant people with a lot of resources, who have already created amazing content, which is already proven to work - we are not trying to compete with them.
2. We are practical - learning theoretical aspects behind artificial intelligence workings is important, but only the code, which you write and the results, which you achieve will prove that you understand AI.
3. We aim to maximize your success rate - we do what is necessary for you to achieve the goal of becoming an AI expert.
4. We are using free content - there should be a way to complete our workshops completely for free.
5. We use agile and lean principles for managing your learning process - agile has revolutionised how we develop software and it also works for teaching people AI.

## The Plan

- You will be grouped into teams - each team member will help understand the content and stay motivated.
- You will learn in week-long sprints. For those of you, who are not familiar with Scrum, a sprint is just a time-boxed iteration of effort.
- At the beginning of each sprint, we will have a sprint planning, where we will decide on your sprint goal and tasks required to achieve this goal.
- During the sprint, you will work on online courses, Kaggle competitions or portfolio building projects based on your goal for the sprint.
- At the end of each sprint, we will have a sprint review, where you will present how well you have managed to achieve your goal.
- After each sprint (after the sprint review, but before the sprint planning), we will have a sprint retrospective, where we try to improve your learning process.
- You will receive support from and provide support to other teams, which will be learning similar things, just at a different level.
- You will have fun!

## The Classes

Tribe of AI has five different curriculums depending on your current skill level, called classes. F class is for absolute beginners and S class is for people skilled in deep learning, who want to do AI projects. You can learn about each of the classes and how to choose a class, which is right for you current skill level below.

- S class | AI projects
- A class | advanced deep learning
- B class | deep learning fundamentals
- C class | machine learning
- D class | data science
- E class | advanced Python
- F class | Python fundamentals

## Team Types

There are two types of teams - remote teams and regular teams. The difference between remote teams and regular teams are that the regular teams meet every Saturday and remote teams don't physically meet. All team types of the same class learn using the same course curriculum and have access to the same materials. Choosing the team type depends on your ability to meet every Saturday and ability to commit at least 8 hours per week for learning. If you can do that then apply for the regular team and if not then go for remote teams.

### Regular Teams

- Goal: teach you practical AI skills
- Time: every Saturday
- Team size: up to 16 people
- Time commitment: 8+ hours / week

### Remote Teams

- Goal: teach you practical AI skills.
- Time: flexible
- Team size: no limit
- Time commitment: flexible
